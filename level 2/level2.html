    <!--Absolute units-->
    <!--Absolute units are fixed measurement units used in web design and digital graphics, such as pixels (px), points (pt), and inches (in), providing a consistent size regardless of the display or resolution.
    Absolute units are fixed measurement units in web design, such as pixels (px), points (pt), and inches (in), providing a consistent size across different devices and resolutions. They are used to define dimensions and spacing in a way that remains constant, regardless of the user's screen size or resolution.
    The syntax for absolute units is straightforward, using units like px for pixels, pt for points, and in for inches. For example, width: 300px; height: 200pt; margin: 1in; are common CSS declarations that specify dimensions in absolute units.
    Absolute units are used in web design to ensure consistent sizing and spacing across different devices and resolutions, making them ideal for fixed layouts and print styles.-->
